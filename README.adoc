== Ruby DDD Sample App

=== Goal

The goal of this sample app is to provide an idiomatic Ruby port of the DDD sample application. It should remain faithful to the intention of the sample application by:

* Providing 

==== DDD Sample Application

* link:https://github.com/SzymonPobiega/DDDSample.Net[Port of Java 1.0 branch to .NET in 2010/2011] - using this as the primary basis for this port.

Details here about other sample apps. Things that are unique to this implementation.

Maybe (if I have time) could implement app in Rails using ActiveRecord with Mongoid, and then using repositories with Curator (and maybe Sinatra?). I wonder which one will be harder?

== Persistence

==== Mongoid

* Echo sample app - take a look at `application.rb` - it's using Sidekiq and Kiqstand (not sure what for...maybe could be used for aggregate updates?)

=== Repository Pattern in Ruby

* https://github.com/nfedyashev/repository[A Ruby implementation of the Repository Pattern - In memory only], developed from https://github.com/alexch/treasury[Repository Pattern for Ruby - 3 years old]. 
* https://github.com/playlouder/persistence[A set of interfaces for, and implementations of, the Repository pattern in Ruby.] This one looks promising.
* https://github.com/brandonweiss/collector[Collector is an implementation of the Repository Pattern for MongoDB]
* https://github.com/braintree/curator[Curator is a model and repository framework for Ruby].Currently, curator supports Riak, MongoDB and an in-memory data store for persistence.

=== Aggregate Update

Tools for Implementing Eventual Consistency (i.e. performing asynchronous updates).
